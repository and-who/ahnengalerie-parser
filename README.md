# ahnen-gallery 2 GEDCOM - Parser

This Code is able to read Files from an old Genealogy Software called "Ahnengalerie" which my Grandpa used.
It is not perfekt but i was able to read and convert his Files with it.

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Analysing

To figure out the Original File Format I used the Program [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex).
See my file for a single Entry [./imhex/ahnenbaum.hexpad](./imhex/ahnenbaum.hexpad)
